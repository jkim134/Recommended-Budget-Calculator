Recommended Budget Calculator Project

In my project idea, I wanted to do a recommended budget calculator. For my program, all you have to do is input an income amount and it will automatically calculate and allocate the budget to each expense category. 

The recommended budget categories and percentages were inspired by Chime, a banking service. The link is where I got the percentages:

For the project, I was also inspired by the work of Katie Musso who is a fellow Kennesaw State University student. I really like how she coded her Budgeting program so I used it in my program. I added things and took out a few things to make it fit mine. Her project is in the link:

I hope you enjoy my project! 

Thank you!
