<h1>Recommended Budget Calculator Project</h1>

<p>In my project idea, I wanted to do a recommended budget calculator. For my program, all you have to do is input an income amount and it will automatically calculate and allocate the budget to each expense category.</p> 

<p>The recommended budget categories and percentages were inspired by Chime, a banking service. In an article written by Chonce Maddox of Chime, they specifided a budgeting plan/outline. The link is where I got the percentages:</p>

<p>For the project, I was also inspired by the work of Katie Musso who is a fellow Kennesaw State University student. I really like how she coded her Budgeting program so I used it in my program. I added things and took out a few things to make it fit mine. Her project is in the link:</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my project!</p> 

<p>Thank you!</p>
