<h1>Project Roadmap</h1>

<p>[DONE] 1. Each person should have an approved project topic (Turn in Ex 6 and ensure you are listed completely in the Teams Projects Spreadsheet).</p>
<p>[DONE] 2. Each person should have established a Github account and joined our class organization (KSU-IS) in Github by accepting the invite email.</p>
<p>[DONE] 3. Each person should also be associated with ownership of a code repository in our Github organization. If on a team, ensure each has Owner or Maintainer Role.</p>
<p>[DONE] 4. Each person should have edited and committed changes in a readme.md file in their repository in our Github organization. The commits should show in Github.</p>
<p>[DONE] 5. Each person should have explored at least one existing Python code base related to their project to evaluate using it in their project and submitted updates to the projectroadmap.md file explaining their findings. In evaluating your codebase, you should have read the code and attempted to run it yourself.</p>
<p>  [DONE] 5.1 Find related python code.</p>
<p>    https://github.com/ksu-is/Budgeting</p>
<p>  [DONE] 5.2 Evaluate code and note down findings.</p>
<ul>
<li>  Code ran in Mircosoft Visual Studio Code.</li>
<li>    Will use in project.</li>
<li>    Need to add calculations.</li>
<li>    Don't need expense function.</li>
<li>    Make Q for quit.</li>
</ul>  
  
<p>[DONE] 6. Each person should making small updates and adding commit messages with them in your repository in our Github organization so that your work is visible. Do this with Github desktop. Otherwise, it will appear you are not working, and you will fail to demonstrate your knowledge of the application development process, which is one of our course goals. Thus, even if you claim to be working on your own machine but fail to post updates in Github in our shared organization where the professor can see them, you will fail on this grading item. Each person should have committed at least 6 code changes of significant size (not just a spelling error fix for example). Each commit should include a comment that explains what you did. The comment must be specific (ie. not just Updated README.md but rather explain what your update was and why you did it briefly).</p>
<p>  [DONE] 6.1 At least 6 code changes </p>
<p>[DONE] 7. Also, you need to be tracking your progress on planned and emerging tasks in your projectroadmap.md document. I will look for changes in this document as signs of your progress. Using checkboxes, adding new tasks as they emerge, or adding “DONE” to mark done items all could count here.</p>
<p>    [DONE] 7.1 Add "DONE" to finsihed processes and tasks.</p>
    
<p>[DONE] 8. Continue coding and refining and testing in Sprint 3 as in Sprint 2. I will look for additional progress. If you had minor scope for your project and finish already, you need to add more scope and work on it.</p>
<p>[DONE] 9. Create one PowerPoint slide introducing your project and upload it. If you have more than one teammate, each needs to turn-in a copy in D2L to ensure everyone has a copy. The slide needs to be attractive and informative. Be sure to include this information:</p>
<ul>  
<li>  [DONE] 1. List your project team members.
<li>  [DONE] 1. Show the title of your project.
<li>  [DONE] 1. Show a tag line that introduces the main concept of what it does/will do.
<li>  [DONE] 1. Show 1-2 screenshots or pictures demonstrating the idea or parts (optional) Each person must upload a PPT slide in D2L. Each team must ensure there is a copy in their Github repository so that future coders can quickly grasp the idea.
</ul>  

<p>[DONE] 1. We will be looking at presentations and talking about the results during our final exam period (for non-online classes). We might experiment with some of the code too. This last date is worth some of the grade, but you can only earn the credit if you have turned in the presentation video in advance of the presentation time.</p>
